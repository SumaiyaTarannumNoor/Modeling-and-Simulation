## Definitions

**Sample Space (S):**  
The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

**Event (A):**  
A subset of the sample space, representing a specific outcome or set of outcomes.

**Probability Measure (P):**  
A function that assigns a probability value to each event, such that:
- The probability of any event is between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
- The probability of the entire sample space is 1.

## Example

Imagine flipping a fair coin.

- **Sample Space (S):**  
  {Heads (H), Tails (T)}

- **Event (A):**  
  Getting Heads. This is a subset of the sample space:  
  A = {H}

- **Probability Measure (P):**
  - P(H) = 1/2 (probability of getting heads)
  - P(T) = 1/2 (probability of getting tails)
  - P(S) = P(H) + P(T) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

In this example, the probability measure assigns a probability of 1/2 to both the event of getting heads and the event of getting tails, and the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes (the sample space) is 1.
