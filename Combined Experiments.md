# Combined Experiments in Probability

A **combined experiment** in probability involves conducting two or more individual experiments and considering the outcomes of all of them together to determine the probability of specific combined events.

You can determine the probability of combined events by:

- Systematically listing all possible outcomes  
- Using the **product rule** to find the total number of outcomes  
- Employing **sample space diagrams**

## Methods for Calculating the Probability of Combined Events

### 1. Listing Outcomes Systematically

- **Organized Approach**:  
  List all possible outcomes in a logical and organized way to avoid missing any.

- **Product Rule**:  
  To find the total number of outcomes for multiple events, multiply the number of outcomes for each individual event.

- **Pairing Outcomes**:  
  For two events, pair each outcome of the first event with every outcome of the second event until all combinations are listed.

### 2. Calculating Probability

- **Fraction Form**:  
  Express the probability as a fraction where:  
  `Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes`

- **Simplification**:  
  Simplify the fraction if possible to express the probability in its lowest terms.

## Important Concepts

### Independent Events

If the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another, they are considered **independent**.

- For independent events, the probability of both occurring is:  
  `P(A and B) = P(A) Ã— P(B)`

### Combined Sample Space

When combining two sub-experiments with sample spaces `S1` and `S2`:

- The combined sample space consists of all **ordered pairs** `(s1, s2)`, where:  
  - `s1` is from `S1`  
  - `s2` is from `S2`

### Experimental Probability

This type of probability is determined by conducting trials and observing the results.

- It is calculated as:  
  `Experimental Probability = Number of times the event occurs / Total number of trials`
