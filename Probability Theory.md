## Sample Space
    |
    S

List of all possible outcomes of an experiment
```
                                     |
                         Flip a coin or Roll a die
```

```
S1 = {H, T}         // S1: Sample space for flipping a coin
S2 = {HH, HT, TH, TT} // S2: Sample space for flipping two coins
S3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} // S3: Sample space for rolling a die
```

## Event Space
Event Space - Set of all possible subsets of sample space.
```
        |                     |
   Power of set "S"      Power Set P(S)
```

S = {H, T}, P(S) = {{H}, {T}, {H, T}, Î¦}
```
             |      |
P({H, T}) = P({H}) + P({T})          P(H) = 1/2 P({H})
                  = 1
```
