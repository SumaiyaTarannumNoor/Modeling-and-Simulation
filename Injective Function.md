## Injective Function 
An injective function, also known 
as a one-to-one function, is a function 
where distinct elements in the input set 
(domain) are mapped to distinct elements 
in the output set (codomain). In simpler terms, 
each input element corresponds to a unique 
output element, and no two different input 
elements map to the same output element.
